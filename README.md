# Read me

This application includes three frameworks such as Oauth2, Locksmith, and Cosmos. In order to make it work on Xcode, you might have to download them beforehand.


# Little bit of background story

As I've been on the endless journey to learn new features day by day, I realized how important the server part is in the whole process. Due to the lack of capabilities to handle with the server part, I tried to rely on Firebase or Realm but it wasn't long until I noticed it's quiet different so I looked for open APIs like iTunes or Yelp which are involved in this application.

# Skill Summary

This application is built on both programtaically and with storyboard.

iTunes: this section is focused on efficiently handling with APIs. I chose not to use Alamofire to fully grasp the idea of how things work under hood. It also includes the customized AVplayer used to listen to songs of your selection.

Yelp: Yelp server requires token for data requested by third-party users / applications.
I includes several frameworks to demonstrate that I can do work with them without any problems. It involves OAuth2, LockSmith, and Cosmos(star-ratigin framework).
Based on the location of the current user / set-up location on simulator, it shows near-by restaurants or you can serach for it.

Selfie: CoreData and CoreImage. This part is designed to show that I can handle with CoreData and CoreImage.  After chosing what filter you'd like to apply to chosen picture, you can save it to disk. It also has image viwer and zoom features.

# Even though it's not included in this app

I have experience with the followgins:
- chatting application powered by Firebase
- Instragram-like app powered by Firebase
- social login by Firebase
